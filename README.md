# NYC Citi Bike
My analysis on the NYC Citi Bike.

# Overview of Project
	The data provided to me in one file, represent a raw information of NYC Citi Bike 

# Purpose
To help Kate to simply understand the provided data and giving her elements to make the right decision on opening a Citi Bike in Des Moines, Ohio.
# Analysis and Challenges
Many Tableau functions did not work well when trying to make new worksheets until I have updated my material version.


# Results
•	Checkout Times for Users Visualization: The peak was recorded at 3005 counts of citibike.csv(counts) for 5.25 hours.
•	Checkout times by gender visualization: the peak was recorded at2,152 counts for trip duration of 5.75 hours for male gender. 
•	Checkout times by gender visualization: the peak was recorded at746counts for trip duration of 6.5 hours for female gender.
•	Trips by weekdays for each Hour: Thursday 6pm had recorded the highest number of 44,905 counts.
•	Trips by gender (weekday per Hour): the gender male had recorded the highest portion especially on Thursdays and between 5pm and 6 pm.
•	User trips by gender by weekday: the gender male had recorded the highst counts of 259,316 on Thursday.
• Bike utilization: the bike id 39,570 had recorded the highst number of time utilization.

# Summary
I do not have access to see where exactly Kate wants to implant her new shop, and she should check for the following:

•	Gather data bus transport efficiency rate.
•	Gather data on traffic rate.
•	Get another visualization for start station by gender.
•	Get another visualization for trips by weekday by hour and by gender.
